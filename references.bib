  abstract = {Climate change mitigation efforts to achieve net-zero emissions require not only decreasing current greenhouse gas emissions, but also the deployment of negative emissions technologies. Soil organic carbon sequestration in agricultural lands is one such negative emissions strategy, currently being incentivized predominantly through voluntary carbon offset markets. Through semi-structured interviews, we assess both conventional and organic farmer perspectives on soil carbon offset programs that have been created in the United States since 2017. The perspectives of farmers both participating and not participating in agricultural soil carbon markets were similar and consistent. Farmers in both groups expressed concerns about the convoluted, burdensome and unpredictable nature of receiving offset credits and emphasized that they were implementing practices for their own business interests and sustainability concerns, not the financial incentive of the generation of carbon credits. Based on our research, carbon offset credit payments for agricultural soil carbon sequestration are largely reaching farmers who were already implementing these beneficial practices or were already strongly interested in implementing these practices, and the payments for the offset credits are seen as a ‘gravy on top’, suggesting that these offset markets face strong challenges of ensuring true additionality essential to effective climate mitigation.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the ‘per-pixel paradigm’ and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

  abstract = {Cloud detection in optical remote sensing images is a crucial problem because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in the analyses of surface and atmospheric parameters. Sentinel-2 provides high spatial resolution satellite data distributed with associated cloud masks. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 Level-1C cloud mask products to discriminate clouds over a variety of biogeographic scenarios and in different cloudiness conditions. Reference cloud masks for the identification of misdetection were generated by applying a local thresholding method that analyses Sentinel-2 Band 2 (0.490\,μm) and Band 10 (1.375\,μm) separately; histogram-based thresholds were locally tuned by checking the single bands and the natural color composite (B4B3B2); in doubtful cases, NDVI and DEM were also analyzed to refine the masks; the B2B11B12 composite was used to separate snow. The analysis of the cloud classification errors obtained for our test sites allowed us to get important inferences of general value. The L1C cloud mask generally underestimated the presence of clouds (average Omission Error, OE, 37.4\%); this error increased (OE\,{$>$}\,50\%) for imagery containing opaque clouds with a large transitional zone (between the cloud core and clear areas) and cirrus clouds, fragmentation emerged as a major source of omission errors (R2 0.73). Overestimation was prevalently found in the presence of holes inside the main cloud bodies. Two extreme environments were particularly critical for the L1C cloud mask product. Detection over Amazonian rainforests was highly inefficient (OE\,{$>$}\,70\%) due to the presence of complex cloudiness and high water vapor content. On the other hand, Alpine orography under dry atmosphere created false cirrus clouds. Altogether, cirrus detection was the most inefficient. According to our results, Sentinel-2 L1C users should take some simple precautions while waiting for ESA improved cloud detection products.},

  abstract = {Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) is a widely applied tool to retrieve spatially explicit information on urban land cover from both hyperspectral and multispectral data, but is still prone to misclassification errors when faced with high inter-class similarity, typical of the complex urban environment. In this study we assessed multiple ways to minimize spectral confusion using airborne lidar data as an additional data source and spectral feature selection. Several approaches were tested using simulated hyperspectral data and two case studies in the city of Brussels, Belgium, one based on hyperspectral (APEX) data and one on multispectral (Sentinel-2) data. We found that the implementation of height distribution information (1) as an endmember model selection tool and (2) as a basis for additional fraction constraints at the individual pixel scale, significantly reduced spectral confusion between spectrally similar, but structurally different land cover classes (on average by 80\% for the APEX case). This had a net positive effect on subpixel fraction estimations (average R2 increased from 0.34 to 0.80 and from 0.23 to 0.63 for APEX and Sentinel-2, respectively) and pixel classification accuracies (kappa increased from 0.38 to 0.6 for the APEX case). When applied to fine spatial resolution data containing many single-class pixels, endmember model selection based on height information resulted in the additional benefit of lowering computation times by 85\%. Spectral feature selection successfully discarded redundant spectral information (on average retaining only 19 out of 218 bands), thereby further lowering processing times by 50\%, without affecting accuracies. Despite these significant improvements, spectral confusion remained an issue between classes showing no distinction in height information, particularly pavement and soil. Future research should therefore focus on integrating the proposed approach with advanced endmember detection and selection algorithms, along with exploring innovative ways of highlighting small spectral differences using spectral transformations. The algorithm we propose constitutes a viable approach for mapping of structurally diverse ecosystems, such as urban environments, at multiple spatial scales and with varying level of thematic detail.},

Data and methods~ ~Internal migration data from the Australian 2011 Census of Population and Housing, which records people who have moved between Greater Capital City Statistical Areas over 5-year periods, is used to exemplify the modelling process. The R statistical software is used to process and visualise the data as well as run the models. Results~ ~The full suite of Wilson’s family of spatial interaction models is fitted to the internal migration data, revealing that distance and origin/destination populations are some of the most important influencing factors affecting internal migration flows. We see whether constraining the model to known flows about origins and/or destinations will improve the fits and model estimates. Conclusions~ ~Spatial interaction modelling has been a tool in the box of some population geographers for a number of decades. However, recent advances in more forgiving programming languages such as R and Python now mean that this powerful modelling methodology is no longer only available to those who also possess advanced computer programming skills. This guide has exemplified the process of fitting and calibrating spatial interaction models on Australian internal migration data, but the methods could easily be applied to other flow data sets in other contexts.},

  abstract = {Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing for soil organic carbon (SOC) mapping in exposed croplands. However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) {$<$} 0.25, (3–5) NDVI {$<$} 0.25 and NBR2 {$<$} threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 {$<$} threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI {$<$} 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI {$>$} 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 {$<$} 0.30, RMSE {$>$} 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD {$<$} 1.4, n {$>$} 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 {$<$} 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62\%, compared to 95\% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied.},

  abstract = {Precise assessment of drought and its impact on the natural ecosystem is an arduous task in regions with limited climatic observations due to sparsely distributed in situ stations, especially in the hyper-arid region of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore, this study investigates the application of remote sensing techniques to monitor drought and compare the remote sensing-retrieved drought indices (RSDIs) with the standardized meteorological drought index (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI) during 2001–2020. The computed RSDIs include Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), which are derived using multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellites, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) is used to find the extent of agreement between the SPEI and RSDIs. The comparison showed CC values of 0.74, 0.67, 0.57, and 0.47 observed for VHI/SPEI-12, VHI/SPEI-6, VHI/SPEI-3, and VHI/SPEI-1, respectively. Comparatively low agreement was observed between TCI and SPEI with CC values of 0.60, 0.61, 0.42, and 0.37 observed for TCI/SPEI-12, TCI/SPEI-6, TCI/SPEI-3, and TCI/SPEI-1. A lower correlation with CC values of 0.53, 0.45, 0.33 and 0.24 was observed for VCI/SPEI-12, VCI/SPEI-6, VCI/SPEI-3, and VCI/SPEI-1, respectively. Overall, the results suggest that VHI and SPEI are better correlated drought indices and are suitable for drought monitoring in the data-scarce hyper-arid regions. This research will help to improve our understanding of the relationships between meteorological and remote sensing drought indices.},

  abstract = {Vitoria-Gasteiz has taken several urban greening actions such as the introduction of a ring of parks that connect the city’s surroundings, a sustainable mobility plan, and urban green structure strategies. Previous studies establish a connection to the importance of greening to mitigate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on urban climate. In this study, land surface temperature (LST), a remote sensing (RS) parameter, recorded by Landsat satellites (5, 7, and 8) was used to evaluate the effect of SUHI in Vitoria-Gasteiz between 1985–2021. The aim was to evaluate whether the urban greening actions influenced the local thermal conditions and, consequently, helped minimize the SUHI. Thirty sampling locations were identified, corresponding to different local climate zones (LCZ), at which LST data were extracted. A total of 218 images were processed and separated into summer and winter. Four of the 30 locations had, since 2003, on-site meteorological stations with regular air temperature (Tair) measurements which were used to validate the LST data. The results showed that Spearman’s correlation between Tair and LST was higher than 0.88 in all locations. An amount of 21 points maintained the same LCZ classification throughout the analysed period and nine underwent a LCZ transformation. The highest average temperature was identified in the city centre (urbanized area), and the lowest average was in a forest on the outskirts of the city. SUHI was more intense during the summer. A significant increase in SUHI intensity was identified in areas transformed from natural to urban LCZs. However, SUHI during satellite data acquisition periods has shown a minimal change in areas where sustainable practices have been implemented. RS was valuable for analysing the thermal behaviour of the LCZs, despite the limitation inherent in the satellite’s time of passage, in which the SUHI effect is not as evident.},

The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.},

  abstract = {Google Street View (GSV) presents the world as fact, mapped and documented, and reconstituted online: an approximation of the street condition. Google’s fleet takes the built environment as its territory, renders it photographically, and maps it spatially. GSV’s comprehensive coverage makes it useful for daily navigational needs, and its diverse mapped terrain encourages user innovation, experimentation, and exploration. As a spatial representation, it brings together two distinct ways of knowing the world through empirical documentation: mapping and photography. Whereas maps offer visual diagrams of spatial information, photographs offer documents with spatiotemporal specificity. Together, the spatialized image becomes the mode of navigation and exploration. This article draws on the embodied subject, wayfinding, and perception in relation to spatial knowledge formation to consider GSV’s ability to alter existing daily practices. Rather than the sensorial rich primary experience of moving through the world, the visually rich secondary experiences via GSV come to inform our navigation and exploration through image recognition. This article argues that the platform’s spatialized image and efficient technological layer produces a shift from the embodied experience of place to the image as experience.},

While a classifier trained from a previous image (source domain) cannot be directly applied to the current image (target domain) because of changes in imaging conditions and dynamics of land surface spectral properties, domain transfer techniques have been introduced in recent years to remove the need for a complete retraining of the current image data. This approach is further developed in the present study, and a domain transfer algorithm named Temporal-Adaptive Support Vector Machine (TASVM) is proposed. The algorithm enables the adaptation of a classifier trained with the source-domain image to the classification of the target-domain image where class data have a different distribution. The adaptation process is allowed to be conducted at the classifier-level where the source classifiers can be transferred without re-accessing the source domain raw data. Experimental analysis showed that the proposed algorithm generated stable results, especially under the circumstances where satisfactory results were hard to achieve with traditional algorithms.},

  abstract = {Reflectance composites that capture bare soil pixels from multispectral image data are increasingly being analysed to model soil constituents such as soil organic carbon. These temporal composites are used instead of single-date multispectral images to account for the frequent vegetation cover of soils and, thus, to get broader spatial coverage of bare soil pixels. Most soil compositing techniques require thresholds derived from spectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalised Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) to separate bare soils from all other land cover types. However, the threshold derivation is handled based on expert knowledge of a specific area, statistical percentile definitions or in situ data. For operational processors, such site-specific and partly manual strategies are not applicable. There is a need for a more generic solution to derive thresholds for large-scale processing without manual intervention. This study presents a novel HIstogram SEparation Threshold (HISET) methodology deriving spectral index thresholds and testing them for a Sentinel-2 temporal data stack. The technique is spectral index-independent, data-driven and can be evaluated based on a quality score. We tested HISET for building six soil reflectance composites (SRC) using NDVI, NBR2 and a new index combining the NDVI and a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (PV+IR2). A comprehensive analysis of the spectral and spatial performance and accuracy of the resulting SRCs proves the flexibility and validity of HISET. Disturbance effects such as spectral confusion of bare soils with non-photosynthetic-active vegetation (NPV) could be reduced by choosing grassland and crops as input LC for HISET. The NBR2-based SRC spectra showed the highest similarity with LUCAS spectra, the broadest spatial coverage of bare soil pixels and the least number of valid observations per pixel. The spatial coverage of bare soil pixels is validated against the database of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) of the European Commission. Validation results show that PV+IR2-based SRCs outperform the other two indices, especially in spectrally mixed areas of bare soil, photosynthetic-active vegetation and NPV. The NDVI-based SRCs showed the lowest confidence values (95\%) in all bands. In the future, HISET shall be tested in other areas with different environmental conditions and LC characteristics to evaluate if the findings of this study are also valid.},

  abstract = {Accurate land cover classification (LCC) is essential for studying global change. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used for LCC due to its advantage of weather independence. In particular, the dual-polarization (dual-pol) SAR data have a wider coverage and are easier to obtain, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for LCC. However, the dual-pol SAR data have a weak discrimination ability due to limited polarization information. Moreover, the complex imaging mechanism leads to the speckle noise of SAR images, which also decreases the accuracy of SAR LCC. To address the above issues, an improved dual-pol radar vegetation index based on multiple components (DpRVIm) and a new LCC method are proposed for dual-pol SAR data. Firstly, in the DpRVIm, the scattering information of polarization and terrain factors were considered to improve the separability of ground objects for dual-pol data. Then, the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) algorithm were used to analyze the effect of difference dual-pol radar vegetation indexes on LCC. Finally, in order to reduce the influence of the speckle noise, a two-stage LCC method, the 1DCNN-MRF, based on the 1DCNN and Markov random field (MRF) was designed considering the spatial information of ground objects. In this study, the HH-HV model data of the Gaofen-3 satellite in the Dongting Lake area were used, and the results showed that: (1) Through the combination of the backscatter coefficient and dual-pol radar vegetation indexes based on the polarization decomposition technique, the accuracy of LCC can be improved compared with the single backscatter coefficient. (2) The DpRVIm was more conducive to improving the accuracy of LCC than the classic dual-pol radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and radar vegetation index (RVI), especially for farmland and forest. (3) Compared with the classic machine learning methods K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and the 1DCNN, the designed 1DCNN-MRF achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy (OA) score of 81.76\% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) score of 0.74. This study indicated the application potential of the polarization decomposition technique and DEM in enhancing the separability of different land cover types in SAR LCC. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the combination of deep learning networks and MRF is suitable to suppress the influence of speckle noise.},

The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP “land cover classification system”. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.},

Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.}

  abstract = {Cities are growing geographically in response to the enormous increase in urban population; consequently, comprehending growth and environmental changes is critical for long-term planning. Urbanization transforms naturally permeable surfaces into impermeable surfaces, causing an increase in urban land surface temperature, leading to the phenomenon known as urban heat islands. The urban heat islands are noticeable across Malaysia's rural communities and villages, particularly in Kuala Lumpur. These effects must be addressed to slow, if not halt, climate change and meet the Paris Agreement's 2030 goal. The study posits an application of thermal remote sensing utilizing a space-borne satellite-based technique to demonstrate urban evolution for urban heat island analysis and its relationship to land surface temperature. The urban heat island (UHI) was analyzed by converting infrared radiation into visible thermal images utilizing thermal imaging from remote sensing techniques. The heat island is validated by reference to the characteristics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which define the land surface temperature (LST) of distinct locations. Based on the digital information from the satellite, the highest temperature difference between urban and rural regions for a few chosen cities in 2013 varied from 10.8 to 25.5~°C, while in 2021, it ranged from 16.1 to 26.73~°C, highlighting crucial temperature changes. The results from ANOVA test has substantially strengthened the credibility of the significant temperature changes. Some notable reveals are as follows: The Sungai Batu area, due to its rapid development and industry growth, was more vulnerable to elevated urban heat due to reduced vegetation cover; therefore, higher relative vulnerability. Contrary, the Bukit Ketumbar area, which region lies in the woodland region, experienced the lowest, with urban heat islands reading from 2013~at −0.3044 and 0.0154 in 2021. It shows that despite having urban heat islands increase two-fold from 2013 to 2021, increasing the amount of vegetation coverage is a simple and effective way of reducing the urban heat island effect, as evidenced by the low urban heat islands in the Bukit Ketumbar woodland region. The study findings are critical for advising municipal officials and urban planners to decrease urban heat islands by investing in open green spaces.},

Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing measurements provide an accurate and timeous record of the landscape components. This enables the extraction of important information from images pertaining to spatial distribution of land cover captured by various earth observation satellites. Hence, up-to-date land cover information is of critical importance to planners, scientists, resource managers, decision makers and various applications. The choice of an optimum sensor for land cover mapping is influenced by its spatial, temporal resolution and spectral resolution. Therefore the availability of new earth observation data, such as SPOT 6, which has improved spatial and spectral resolutions from its predecessor, revolutionize the utility of contemporary methods for land cover mapping. Recognizing the opportunity to map land cover at high resolution from SPOT 6, this evaluated the conventional pixel-based classification methods (namely; supervised Maximum Likelihood Classifier and unsupervised ISODATA classifier) and object-based (K-Nearest Neighbour) classification methods for their performance in mapping land cover in a semi-arid environment. Semi-arid environments are usually comprised of discrete land cover units, as a result, sophisticate land cover mapping activities since the resultant classes are largely generalised especially when using high spatial resolution data. This was identified as a gap; and therefore, was addressed. The study found that object-based K-NN classifier performed better than pixel-based ISODATA and Maximum Likelihood classifiers, with overall accuracies of 82\%, 50.7\% and 36.7\% respectively. We concluded that SPOT 6 data, coupled with object-based classification methods have potential to provide rapid land cover classifications for South Africa.},

The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations.

The evaluation results showed that the accuracy was higher with a smaller image size and a smaller kernel size, and was more dependent on the convolutional layer configuration and number of layers than the kernel size. The loss tended to be lower as the convolutional layer composition and number of layers increased, regardless of the image size or kernel size. The deep learning model with the best performance recorded a validation loss of 0.11 with an image size of 64 × 64, a convolutional layer configuration of C→C→C→P, a kernel size of 5 × 5, and five layers. Regarding the classification accuracy of the land cover map constructed using this model, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for three study cities showed high agreement at approximately 82.9\% and 66.3\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {In surveying, mapping and geographic information systems, building extraction from remote sensing imagery is a common task. However, there are still some challenges in automatic building extraction. First, using only single-scale depth features cannot take into account the uncertainty of features such as the hue and texture of buildings in images, and the results are prone to missed detection. Moreover, extracted high-level features often lose structural information and have scale differences with low-level features, which results in less accurate extraction of boundaries. To simultaneously address these problems, we propose pyramid feature extraction (PFE) to construct multi-scale representations of buildings, which is inspired by the feature extraction of scale-invariant feature transform. We also apply attention modules in channel dimension and spatial dimension to PFE and low-level feature maps. Furthermore, we use the structural-cue-guided feature alignment module to learn the correlation between feature maps at different levels, obtaining high-resolution features with strong semantic representation and ensuring the integrity of high-level features in both structural and semantic dimensions. An edge loss is applied to get a highly accurate building boundary. For the WHU Building Dataset, our method achieves an F1 score of 95.3\% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 90.9\%; for the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset, our method achieves an F1 score of 85.0\% and an IoU score of 74.1\%.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of urbanization in China, monitoring urban changes is of great significance to city management, urban planning, and cadastral map updating. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can capture a large area of radar images quickly with fine spatiotemporal resolution and are not affected by weather conditions, making multi-temporal SAR images suitable for change detection. In this paper, a new urban building change detection method based on an improved difference image and residual U-Net network is proposed. In order to overcome the intensity compression problem of the traditional log-ratio method, the spatial distance and intensity similarity are combined to generate a weighting function to obtain a weighted difference image. By fusing the weighted difference image and the bitemporal original images, the three-channel color difference image is generated for building change detection. Due to the complexity of urban environments and the small scale of building changes, the residual U-Net network is used instead of fixed statistical models and the construction and classifier of the network are modified to distinguish between different building changes. Three scenes of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath data are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that our proposed method is effective for urban building change detection and is superior to the original U-Net and SVM method.},

The present study develops models to estimate and map above-ground biomass of Mediterranean Quercus rotundifolia stands using one QuickBird satellite image in pan-sharpened mode, with four multispectral bands (blue, green, red and near infrared) and a spatial resolution of 0.70~m. The satellite image was orthorectified, geometrically and radiometrically corrected. Object-oriented classification methods and multi-resolution segmentation were used to derive a vegetation mask per forest species. Data from forest inventory (24 plots) and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SR and SAVI) derived from high spatial resolution satellite images were used for an area of 133~km2, in southern Portugal. The statistical analysis included correlation, variance analysis and linear regression. The linear regression models fitted included the arithmetic mean and the median values of the vegetation indices per inventory plot as explanatory variables. The overall results of the fitted models show a trend of better performance for those with the median value of the vegetation index as the explanatory variable. The best fitted model (R2~=~75.3) was associated with the Simple Ratio (SR) median value as an explanatory variable. A Quercus rotundifolia above-ground biomass map was produced.},

  abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70\% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson's \$r\textasciicircum 2\$) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19\% and 51\% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.},

The raw imagery was obtained from the orthorectified Landsat GeoCover dataset, purchased by NASA from the Earth Satellite Corporation. Through the LEDAPS project, these data were calibrated, converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and then atmospherically corrected using the MODIS/6S methodology. Initial comparisons with ground-based optical thickness measurements and simultaneously acquired MODIS imagery indicate comparable uncertainty in Landsat surface reflectance compared to the standard MODIS reflectance product (the greater of 0.5\% absolute reflectance or 5\% of the recorded reflectance value). The rapid automated nature of the processing stream also paves the way for routine high-level products from future Landsat sensors.},

A Correlation and a regression analysis were used to examine the association of different variables with fire severity and One-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) test was also performed to inspect the damage done by fire and the regrowth potential of the forest ecosystem. According to the result, the total burned area was not alarming. Also, the relationship of fire index with spectral indices, and soil and vegetation properties have been meaningful to understand the impact of the forest fire in Rema-Kalenga. Additionally, significant effects of the fire on the variation of the different properties were also observed. Even though the quantity of burned area in this forest was not significant, fire management in the forest conservation strategies in Bangladesh should be heeded and incorporated to avoid future disasters, keeping in mind the future climate change.},

In Germany, SOC maps are mostly available with a spatial resolution of 250 m to 1 km2. The nationwide availability of both digital elevation models at various spatial resolutions and multi-temporal satellite imagery enables the derivation of multi-scale terrain attributes and (here: Landsat-based) multi-temporal soil reflectance composites (SRC) as explanatory variables. In the example of a Bavarian test of about 8000 km2, relations between 220 SOC content samples as well as different aggregation levels of the explanatory variables were analyzed for their scale-specific predictive power. The aggregation levels were generated by applying a region-growing segmentation procedure, and the SOC content prediction was realized by the Random Forest algorithm. In doing so, established approaches of (geographic) object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and machine learning were combined. The modeling results revealed scale-specific differences. Compared to terrain attributes, the use of SRC parameters leads to a significant model improvement at field-related scale levels. The joint use of both terrain attributes and SRC parameters resulted in further model improvements. The best modeling variant is characterized by an accuracy of R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 1.99.},

  abstract = {Mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the regional level is critical for climate change policy and the mitigation of its adverse effects. However, reliable SOC estimates particularly over a large extent remains a major challenge due to among others limited sample points, quality of simulation data and the algorithm adopted. Remote sensing (RS) strategies have emerged as a suitable alternative to field and laboratory SOC determination, especially at large spatial extent. The use of Sentinel-3 sensor, the latest of the Sentinel series is minimal and has not been fully developed, despite its impressive attributes that include high spectral-temporal resolution and large coverage. Compared to linear and classical ML models, deep learning (DL) models offer a considerable improvement in data analysis due to their ability to extract more representative features and identify complex spatial patterns associated with big data. Yet, there is paucity in literature on the application of dl-based remote sensing strategies for SOC prediction. Consequently, this study adopted a deep neural network (DNN) to predict SOC at a national scale, using Sentinel-3 image, and compared the results with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The models were trained based on 10-fold cross-validation with 1936 soil samples and 31 predictors. The DNN model generated the best result with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.35~t/ha (26~\% of the mean), followed by RF (RMSE~=~11.2~t/ha), ANN (RMSE~=~11.6~t/ha) and SVM (RMSE~=~13.6~t/ha). The analytical prowess of the DNN, together with its ability to handle big data by learning patterns through a series of hidden layers (10) to draw conclusions, gives it an edge over other classical ML models. The study concluded that the DNN model with Sentinel-3 data is promising and provides an effective framework for continuous national level SOC modelling.},

In this context, the segmentation of different objects such as cars, airplanes, ships, and buildings that are independent of background and objects such as land use and vegetation classes, which are difficult to discriminate from the background is considered. However, in image segmentation studies, various difficulties such as shadow, image blockage, a disorder of background, lighting, shading that cause fundamental modifications in the appearance of features are often encountered. With the development of technology, obtaining high spatial resolution satellite imageries and aerial photographs contain detailed texture information have been facilitated easily. Parallel to these improvements, deep learning architectures have widely been used to solved several computer vision tasks with an increasing level of difficulty. Thus, the regional characteristics, artificial and natural objects, can be perceived and interpreted precisely. In this study, two different subset data that were produced from a great open-source labeled image sets were used to segmentation of roads. The used labeled data set consists of 150 satellite images of size 1500 x 1500 pixels at a 1.2 m resolution, which was not efficient for training. In order to avoid any problem, the imageries were divided into smaller dimensions. Selected images from the data set divided into small patches of 256 x 256 pixels and 512 x 512 pixels to train the system, and comparisons between them were carried out. To train the system using these datasets, two different artificial neural network architectures U-Net and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), which are used for object segmentation on high-resolution images, were selected. When the test data with the same size as the training data set were analyzed, approximately 97\% extraction accuracy was obtained from high-resolution imageries trained by FCN in 512 x 512 dimensions.},

  abstract = {All over the world, the rapid urbanization process is challenging the sustainable development of our cities. In 2015, the United Nation highlighted in Goal 11 of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) the importance to “Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for proper indicators, representing different aspects of city conditions, obviously including the Land Cover (LC) changes and the urban climate with its most distinct feature, the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the aspects of UHI is the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), which has been investigated through airborne and satellite remote sensing over many years. The purpose of this work is to show the present potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the huge and continuously increasing free satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for long-term and wide spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and its connection with LC changes. A large-scale spatio-temporal procedure was implemented under GEE, also benefiting from the already established Climate Engine (CE) tool to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery and the simple indicator Detrended Rate Matrix was introduced to globally represent the net effect of LC changes on SUHI. The implemented procedure was successfully applied to six metropolitan areas in the U.S., and a general increasing of SUHI due to urban growth was clearly highlighted. As a matter of fact, GEE indeed allowed us to process more than 6000 Landsat images acquired over the period 1992–2011, performing a long-term and wide spatio-temporal study on SUHI vs. LC change monitoring. The present feasibility of the proposed procedure and the encouraging obtained results, although preliminary and requiring further investigations (calibration problems related to LST determination from Landsat imagery were evidenced), pave the way for a possible global service on SUHI monitoring, able to supply valuable indications to address an increasingly sustainable urban planning of our cities.},

  abstract = {The study and assessment of desertification and/or the advance or retreat of arid areas as a function of natural and anthropogenic causes is necessary for the prediction of future risks from climate change, and to support policymaking, action plans, and mitigation measures that can be taken at local and global scales. Remote sensing enables modelling, monitoring, and prediction of the behaviour of several elements of desertification. There have been numerous approaches to study desertification using remote sensing over the years. This research explored the timeline and global distribution of studies using remote sensing in studying desertification. Additionally, the review evaluated the key methods and variables that have been used to study desertification from remote sensing data. The use of remote sensing for desertification studies can be trace back to 1991. From 2015 to 2020, more than 40 articles were published per year, showing that there has been a recent increase in the use of remote sensing techniques and its availability for monitoring desertification. Most regions of the world affected by desertification are being studied using remote sensing, however, there is a marked geographical variation between the number of studies in various regions, with Asia having disproportionately high number of studies compared to America or Africa. The country with most studies of desertification using remote sensing is China. In terms of satellite data, Landsat images provide the bulk of data used to study desertification, especially the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor. Classification and change detection are the most used methods to study desertification from remote sensing data. Additionally, land cover/land use change and vegetation and its attributes (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI) are the most used variables to study desertification using remote sensing techniques. Finally, the review found major differences in terms of the ranges or thresholds applied to these variables when determining the presence or risk of desertification. Therefore, there is a need to develop thresholds and ranges of changes of key selected variables, which can be used to determine the presence of desertification.},

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

  abstract = {A knowledge of the characteristics of urban green spaces (UGSs) such as their abundance, spatial distribution and species composition, has an important role in a range of fields such as urban geography, urban planning and public health. Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health.},

In this paper, we compare current extraction methods in terms of extraction units and extraction models and summarize their strengths and limitations. We discuss the challenges in impervious surface estimation from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery in terms of selection of spatial resolution, spectral band, and extraction method. The uncertainties caused by clouds and snow, shadows, and vegetation occlusion are also analyzed. Automated sample labeling and remote sensing domain knowledge are the main directions in impervious surface extraction using deep learning methods. We should also focus on using continuous time series of high-resolution imagery and multi-source satellite imagery for dynamic monitoring of impervious surfaces.},

To solve this problem, a Markov random field (MRF) with amendment reliability factors classification algorithm (MRF-ARF) is proposed. The ARF is constructed based on the coarse label field of urban region, and different controlling factors are utilized for different sensor data. Then, ARF is involved into the data energy of MRF, to classify the sand, vegetation, farmland, and urban regions, with the gray level co-occurrence matrix textures of Sentinel-1 imagery and the spectral values of the Landsat 8 imagery. In the experiments, Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 images are used with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient to evaluate the proposed algorithm with other algorithms. Results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm has the superiority of about 20\% in overall precision and at least 0.2 in Kappa coefficient than the comparison algorithms. Thus, the problem of insufficient utilization of different sensors data could be solved.},

  abstract = {Geocomputation and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) have essential roles in advancing geographic information science (GIS) and Earth observation to a new stage. GeoAI has enhanced traditional geospatial analysis and mapping, altering the methods for understanding and managing complex human–natural systems. However, there are still challenges in various aspects of geospatial applications related to natural, built, and social environments, and in integrating unique geospatial features into GeoAI models. Meanwhile, geospatial and Earth data are critical components in geocomputation and GeoAI studies, as they can effectively reveal geospatial patterns, factors, relationships, and decision-making processes. This editorial provides a comprehensive overview of geocomputation and GeoAI applications in mapping, classifying them into four categories: (i) buildings and infrastructure, (ii) land use analysis, (iii) natural environment and hazards, and (iv) social issues and human activities. In addition, the editorial summarizes geospatial and Earth data in case studies into seven categories, including in-situ data, geospatial datasets, crowdsourced geospatial data (i.e., geospatial big data), remote sensing data, photogrammetry data, LiDAR, and statistical data. Finally, the editorial presents challenges and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Multi- and hyperspectral cameras on drones can be valuable tools in environmental monitoring. A significant shortcoming complicating their usage in quantitative remote sensing applications is insufficient robust radiometric calibration methods. In a direct reflectance transformation method, the drone is equipped with a camera and an irradiance sensor, allowing transformation of image pixel values to reflectance factors without ground reference data. This method requires the sensors to be calibrated with higher accuracy than what is usually required by the empirical line method (ELM), but consequently it offers benefits in robustness, ease of operation, and ability to be used on Beyond-Visual Line of Sight flights. The objective of this study was to develop and assess a drone-based workflow for direct reflectance transformation and implement it on our hyperspectral remote sensing system. A novel atmospheric correction method is also introduced, using two reference panels, but, unlike in the ELM, the correction is not directly affected by changes in the illumination. The sensor system consists of a hyperspectral camera (Rikola HSI, by Senop) and an onboard irradiance spectrometer (FGI AIRS), which were both given thorough radiometric calibrations. In laboratory tests and in a flight experiment, the FGI AIRS tilt-corrected irradiances had accuracy better than 1.9\% at solar zenith angles up to 70°. The system's low-altitude reflectance factor accuracy was assessed in a flight experiment using reflectance reference panels, where the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) were less than ±2\% for the light panels (25\% and 50\%) and less than ±4\% for the dark panels (5\% and 10\%). In the high-altitude images, taken at 100–150 m altitude, the NRMSEs without atmospheric correction were within 1.4\%–8.7\% for VIS bands and 2.0\%–18.5\% for NIR bands. Significant atmospheric effects appeared already at 50 m flight altitude. The proposed atmospheric correction was found to be practical and it decreased the high-altitude NRMSEs to 1.3\%–2.6\% for VIS bands and to 2.3\%–5.3\% for NIR bands. Overall, the workflow was found to be efficient and to provide similar accuracies as the ELM, but providing operational advantages in such challenging scenarios as in forest monitoring, large-scale autonomous mapping tasks, and real-time applications. Tests in varying illumination conditions showed that the reflectance factors of the gravel and vegetation targets varied up to 8\% between sunny and cloudy conditions due to reflectance anisotropy effects, while the direct reflectance workflow had better accuracy. This suggests that the varying illumination conditions have to be further accounted for in drone-based in quantitative remote sensing applications.},

  abstract = {Rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change many times. Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40~years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

Asian cities, which are rapidly undergoing transformational changes in its land cover, predominantly feature urban signatures at the expenses of natural ecosystems. The rapid urbanization in conjunction with mega developmental projects and industrialization requires sophisticated analytical tools in the synoptic assessments and impact measurements. Remote sensing together with geographical information system (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) plays an important role in developing the spatial maps and assessing the dynamics of land cover in the urban environment. This chapter reviews various remote sensing instruments available to characterize vegetation and water in complex urban environments. The progress with respect to diverse instruments such as panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, and LiDAR in mapping the blue-green infrastructures is reviewed in this chapter. The chapter helps in understanding the diverse initiatives and instruments in mapping the extent and quality of blue-green infrastructures which are vital for the spatial planning of urban landscapes.},

  abstract = {We conducted a systematic review and inventory of recent research achievements related to spaceborne and aerial Earth Observation (EO) data-driven monitoring in support of soil-related strategic goals for a three-year period (2019–2021). Scaling, resolution, data characteristics, and modelling approaches were summarized, after reviewing 46 peer-reviewed articles in international journals. Inherent limitations associated with an EO-based soil mapping approach that hinder its wider adoption were recognized and divided into four categories: (i) area covered and data to be shared; (ii) thresholds for bare soil detection; (iii) soil surface conditions; and (iv) infrastructure capabilities. Accordingly, we tried to redefine the meaning of what is expected in the next years for EO data-driven topsoil monitoring by performing a thorough analysis driven by the upcoming technological waves. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of an EO data-driven soil mapping include: (i) a further leverage of recent artificial intelligence techniques to achieve the desired representativeness and reliability; (ii) a continued effort to share harmonized labelled datasets; (iii) data fusion with in situ sensing systems; (iv) a continued effort to overcome the current limitations in terms of sensor resolution and processing limitations of this wealth of EO data; and (v) political and administrative issues (e.g., funding, sustainability). This paper may help to pave the way for further interdisciplinary research and multi-actor coordination activities and to generate EO-based benefits for policy and economy.},

  abstract = {In agronomy, soil organic carbon (SOC) content is important for the development and growth of crops. From an environmental monitoring viewpoint, SOC sequestration is essential for mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. SOC dynamics in cropland soils should be further studied through various approaches including remote sensing. In order to predict SOC content over croplands in southwestern France (area of 22,177 km²), this study addresses (i) the influence of the dates on which Sentinel-2 (S2) images were acquired in the springs of 2017–2018 as well as the influence of the soil sampling period of a set of samples collected between 2005 and 2018, (ii) the use of soil moisture products (SMPs) derived from Sentinel-1/2 satellites to analyze the influence of surface soil moisture on model performance when included as a covariate, and (iii) whether the spatial distribution of SOC as mapped using S2 is related to terrain-derived attributes. The influences of S2 image dates and soil sampling periods were analyzed for bare topsoil. The dates of the S2 images with the best performance (RPD ≥ 1.7) were 6 April and 26 May 2017, using soil samples collected between 2016 and 2018. The soil sampling dates were also analyzed using SMP values. Soil moisture values were extracted for each sample and integrated into partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The use of soil moisture as a covariate had no effect on the prediction performance of the models; however, SMP values were used to select the driest dates, effectively mapping topsoil organic carbon. S2 was able to predict high SOC contents in the specific soil types located on the old terraces (mesas) shaped by rivers flowing from the southwestern Pyrénées.},

  abstract = {There is a need to update soil maps and monitor soil organic carbon (SOC) in the upper horizons or plough layer for enabling decision support and land management, while complying with several policies, especially those favoring soil carbon storage. This review paper is dedicated to the satellite-based spectral approaches for SOC assessment that have been achieved from several satellite sensors, study scales and geographical contexts in the past decade. Most approaches relying on pure spectral models have been carried out since 2019 and have dealt with temperate croplands in Europe, China and North America at the scale of small regions, of some hundreds of km2: dry combustion and wet oxidation were the analytical determination methods used for 50\% and 35\% of the satellite-derived SOC studies, for which measured topsoil SOC contents mainly referred to mineral soils, typically cambisols and luvisols and to a lesser extent, regosols, leptosols, stagnosols and chernozems, with annual cropping systems with a SOC value of \textasciitilde 15 g·kg−1 and a range of 30 g·kg−1 in median. Most satellite-derived SOC spectral prediction models used limited preprocessing and were based on bare soil pixel retrieval after Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding. About one third of these models used partial least squares regression (PLSR), while another third used random forest (RF), and the remaining included machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM). We did not find any studies either on deep learning methods or on all-performance evaluations and uncertainty analysis of spatial model predictions. Nevertheless, the literature examined here identifies satellite-based spectral information, especially derived under bare soil conditions, as an interesting approach that deserves further investigations. Future research includes considering the simultaneous analysis of imagery acquired at several dates i.e., temporal mosaicking, testing the influence of possible disturbing factors and mitigating their effects fusing mixed models incorporating non-spectral ancillary information.},

While past studies have focused on urban extent mapping, little has been done to reveal changes in vertical structures in built-up areas. In this study, we reconstructed annual urban form dynamics in Beijing, China, from 1990 to 2020, utilizing Landsat time-series data. First, we identified urban growth and renewal years using a temporal segmentation approach. Then, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights through logical reasoning, using the reference height in 2020 and the identified changing years. We evaluated the derived dataset and analyzed the urban growth patterns (i.e., upward and outward) over the past three decades. The detected change years are reliable, with an overall accuracy of 88\% (±1~year). Meanwhile, the reconstructed built-up height data showed good agreement with surveyed results (R2: 0.92), with a root mean square error of 2.87~m and a mean absolute error of 2.07~m. Most expanded built-up areas during 1990–2020 were located at the fringe of the central city, and about 16\% experiencing multiple changes. Overall, outward growth was prominent in Beijing during the first decade, while upward growth became dominant in most districts thereafter. The proposed framework provides a new way to reveal annual urban form dynamics through time series analysis, with great potential to support relevant studies such as urban climate modeling and carbon emissions studies.},

Unlike previous research involving medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images, this study used built-up area maps generated from multiple high-resolution RS images with abundant built-up area edge information to analyze development in Zhengzhou. A transferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) algorithm was developed to map the built-up area maps. The algorithm allows the developed deep learning model used on a certain satellite image to be eligible for other types of satellite images by altering the data distribution with adaptive Wallis filtering (DT-AWF). The proposed method alleviates the pressure of deep learning on the demand for new satellite image samples that are time-consuming and laborious. Additionally, the accuracy of built-up area mapping using this method exceeds 90\%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the map results to observe the urban development of Zhengzhou from 2016 to 2020. We found that Zhengzhou has expanded rapidly since it was defined as a central city in central China in 2016. Additionally, the suburban built-up area has expanded rapidly and developed together with the central city. Further, affected by the policy, the built-up areas in different regions of Zhengzhou has changed differently, the urban edge is more simplified, and the urban internal structure is more compact.},

  abstract = {Desertification has been listed as the top of ten major problems affecting global environmental changes, and represents one of the important reasons of semi-arid grassland degradation. It is therefore crucial to understand ecological environment of semi-arid grasslands and temporal and spatial changes in real time for regional and local environmental protection and management. At present, remote sensing technology is being widely used in monitoring and evaluation of land desertification due to its wide observation range, large amount of information, fast data updating and high accuracy. It represents an advanced method for remote sensing monitoring of desertification by extracting various indicators and constructing feature space. Based on this, this study used Landsat images and field survey data to establish a desertification index (SASDI) model based on the albedo-MSAVI (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) feature space and analyze the relationship between desertification and surface quantitative parameters in semi-arid grassland area. Results show that the SASDI model has a high correlation (R2\,=\,0.7585) with the organic matter in the soil surface and makes full use of multi-dimensional remote sensing information. The index reflects the surface cover, water, and heat combination as well as changes of the desertification land, with a clear biophysical significance. Moreover, the index is simple and easy to obtain, facilitating to quantitative analysis and continuous monitoring of desertification in semi-arid grasslands.},

  abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been widely used for wildfire occurrence and distribution detecting and fire risk assessments. Compared with its commission error, the omission error of MODIS wildfire detection has been revealed as a much more challenging, unsolved issue, and ground-level environmental factors influencing the detection capacity are also variable. This study compared the multiple MODIS fire products and the records of ground wildfire investigations during December 2002–November 2015 in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, in an attempt to reveal the difference in the spatiotemporal patterns of regional wildfire detected by the two approaches, to estimate the omission error of MODIS fire products based on confirmed ground wildfire records, and to explore how instantaneous and local environmental factors influenced the wildfire detection probability of MODIS. The results indicated that across the province, the total number of wildfire events recorded by MODIS was at least twice as many as that in the ground records, while the wildfire distribution patterns revealed by the two approaches were inconsistent. For the 5145 confirmed ground records, however, only 11.10\% of them could be detected using multiple MODIS fire products (i.e., MOD14A1, MYD14A1, and MCD64A1). Opposing trends during the studied period were found between the yearly occurrence of ground-based wildfire records and the corresponding proportion detected by MODIS. Moreover, the wildfire detection proportion by MODIS was 11.36\% in forest, 9.58\% in shrubs, and 5.56\% in grassland, respectively. Random forest modeling suggested that fire size was a primary limiting factor for MODIS fire detecting capacity, where a small fire size could likely result in MODIS omission errors at a threshold of 1 ha, while MODIS had a 50\% probability of detecting a wildfire whose size was at least 18 ha. Aside from fire size, the wildfire detection probability of MODIS was also markedly influenced by weather factors, especially the daily relative humidity and the daily wind speed, and the altitude of wildfire occurrence. Considering the environmental factors’ contribution to the omission error in MODIS wildfire detection, we emphasized the importance of attention to the local conditions as well as ground inspection in practical wildfire monitoring and management and global wildfire simulations.},

  abstract = {Desertification is one of the most serious ecological environmental problems over the past several decades in the arid regions. The quantitative assessment of the desertification degree in sandy lands has also been an essential part of landscape ecology. Based on the character of relief, we proposed a new indicator system, i.e., Normalized Landscapes Index (NLI) to calculate the dynamic trend of the desertification process. The data from three periods of Mu Us sandy land and Kubuqi sandy land in Inner Mongolia were used to verify the accuracy of this method. The results show that, from 1990s to 2010s, the NLI change amount of fixed sandy land and semi-fixed sandy land all had positive values while bare sandy land and water had all negative values for both regions. Over the past 20 years, the desertification reversal phenomenon occurs in Mu Us with the desertification process (DP) of −0.36\%, while a positive development of desertification in Kubuqi with the DP of 0.01\%. The NLI dynamic degree of two sandy lands had the same trend as land use dynamic degree, while NLI was more accurate than the landscape dynamic degree. These findings can provide an important method for comparing the desertification process of the desert and also the meaningful information for prevention and control of desertification and sustainable development for the sandy lands in the arid regions.},

  abstract = {For food security issues or global climate change, there is a growing need for large-scale knowledge of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in agricultural soils. To capture and quantify SOC contents at a field scale, Earth Observation (EO) can be a valuable data source for area-wide mapping. The extraction of exposed soils from EO data is challenging due to temporal or permanent vegetation cover, the influence of soil moisture or the condition of the soil surface. Compositing techniques of multitemporal satellite images provide an alternative to retrieve exposed soils and to produce a data source. The repeatable soil composites, containing averaged exposed soil areas over several years, are relatively independent from seasonal soil moisture and surface conditions and provide a new EO-based data source that can be used to estimate SOC contents over large geographical areas with a high spatial resolution. Here, we applied the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) to the Landsat archive between 1984 and 2014 of images covering Bavaria, Germany. Compared to existing SOC modeling approaches based on single scenes, the 30-year SCMaP soil reflectance composite (SRC) with a spatial resolution of 30 m is used. The SRC spectral information is correlated with point soil data using different machine learning algorithms to estimate the SOC contents in cropland topsoils of Bavaria. We developed a pre-processing technique to address the issue of combining point information with EO pixels for the purpose of modeling. We applied different modeling methods often used in EO soil studies to choose the best SOC prediction model. Based on the model accuracies and performances, the Random Forest (RF) showed the best capabilities to predict the SOC contents in Bavaria (R² = 0.67, RMSE = 1.24\%, RPD = 1.77, CCC = 0.78). We further validated the model results with an independent dataset. The comparison between the measured and predicted SOC contents showed a mean difference of 0.11\% SOC using the best RF model. The SCMaP SRC is a promising approach to predict the spatial SOC distribution over large geographical extents with a high spatial resolution (30 m).},

  abstract = {Building footprint and height are critical information for urban studies and applications. Subsequently, urban planning or development departments dedicate a large amount of time and money to develop and maintain a database for building footprint and height. Currently, many methods exist for building footprint and height information extraction. However, it is still an expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive process to obtain this information. Recent advances in remote sensing, such as airborne LiDAR, high-spatial resolution aerial photography, and object based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, provide new methods to accurately and rapidly extract building footprint and height information at a low cost. Airborne LiDAR technology has been developed to collect detailed and accurate Earth’s surface elevation data. High-spatial resolution color infrared aerial photo can be used for vegetation detection. OBIA has been developed to accurately delineate feature boundary. Coupled with high-spatial resolution color infrared aerial photo and high-vertical accuracy airborne LiDAR data, OBIA holds the potential to detect building footprint and height accurately and rapidly. This research used airborne LiDAR data to extract objects such as buildings and trees. Then color-infrared aerial photos were used to remove trees from the detected objects. Subsequently, OBIA was used to delineate building footprints, while zonal statistics was used to extract building height information. The extracted building footprint and height information was compared to the ground-truth data, and the results revealed that color-infrared aerial photos provide important and irreplaceable information to effectively remove vegetation that being false positively detected as buildings while OBIA can be used to accurately delineate building footprint and zonal statistics can be used to extract building height information.},

  abstract = {Rapid and effective acquisition of crop growth information is a crucial step of precision agriculture for making in-season management decisions. Active canopy sensor GreenSeeker (Trimble Navigation Limited, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a portable device commonly used for non-destructively obtaining crop growth information. This study intended to expand the applicability of GreenSeeker in monitoring growth status and predicting grain yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four field experiments with multiple wheat cultivars and N treatments were conducted during 2013–2015 for obtaining canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) synchronized with four agronomic parameters: leaf area index (LAI), leaf dry matter (LDM), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA). Duration models based on NDVI and RVI were developed to monitor these parameters, which indicated that NDVI and RVI explained 80\%, 68–70\%, 10–12\%, and 67–73\% of the variability in LAI, LDM, LNC and LNA, respectively. According to the validation results, the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) were all {$<$}0.24 and the relative error (RE) were all {$<$}23\%. Considering the variation among different wheat cultivars, the newly normalized vegetation indices rNDVI (NDVI vs. the NDVI for the highest N rate) and rRVI (RVI vs. the RVI for the highest N rate) were calculated to predict the relative grain yield (RY, the yield vs. the yield for the highest N rate). rNDVI and rRVI explained 77–85\% of the variability in RY, the RRMSEs were both {$<$}0.13 and the REs were both {$<$}6.3\%. The result demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring growth parameters and predicting grain yield of winter wheat with portable GreenSeeker sensor.},

  abstract = {This article investigates how remotely sensed lawn characteristics, such as parcel lawn area and parcel lawn greenness, combined with household characteristics, can be used to predict household lawn fertilization practices on private residential lands. This study involves two watersheds, Glyndon and Baisman’s Run, in Baltimore County, Maryland, USA. Parcel lawn area and lawn greenness were derived from high-resolution aerial imagery using an object-oriented classification approach. Four indicators of household characteristics, including lot size, square footage of the house, housing value, and housing age were obtained from a property database. Residential lawn care survey data combined with remotely sensed parcel lawn area and greenness data were used to estimate two measures of household lawn fertilization practices, household annual fertilizer nitrogen application amount (N\_yr) and household annual fertilizer nitrogen application rate (N\_ha\_yr). Using multiple regression with multi-model inferential procedures, we found that a combination of parcel lawn area and parcel lawn greenness best predicts N\_yr, whereas a combination of parcel lawn greenness and lot size best predicts variation in N\_ha\_yr. Our analyses show that household fertilization practices can be effectively predicted by remotely sensed lawn indices and household characteristics. This has significant implications for urban watershed managers and modelers.},
